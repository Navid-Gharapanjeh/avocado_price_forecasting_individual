    "# 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I define the business context, objectives, success criteria, and constraints for the avocado price forecasting project. The Business Understanding phase is the critical first step in the CRISP-DM methodology, establishing a clear foundation for all subsequent phases. In this section, we'll cover:\n",
    "- Market overview and trends\n",
    "- Business objectives and research questions\n",
    "- Success criteria and metrics\n",
    "- Project constraints and resources\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is CRISP-DM?** The CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a proven, robust process model for guiding data mining and machine learning projects. It consists of six phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is Business Understanding important?** This phase ensures that the project addresses actual business needs rather than being a purely technical exercise. By clearly defining objectives and success criteria upfront, we can ensure that our modeling efforts remain focused on delivering tangible business value.\n",

    "## The Avocado Boom: A Decade of Growth and Consumption Surge\n",
    "\n",
    "The avocado has transitioned from a niche product to a global dietary staple, witnessing a remarkable surge in consumption over the past ten years. This growth is driven by increasing awareness of its health benefits, culinary versatility, and expanded availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global Consumption Trends\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Significant Global Expansion:** The global avocado industry has experienced substantial growth, with production and trade expanding rapidly.

    "\n",
    "### 1.2.1. Technical Success Criteria:\n",
    "Based on my research, it would be hard to say what score is good or excellent for each model, and the numbers here are based on my general research. For instance, I'm not sure that R² ≥ 0.7 in linear regression is good for this context or not. I think there would be a formula or something to identify what is an acceptable score for each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **R² ≥ 0.7 for Linear Regression:**\n",
    "    * *Justification:* Represents a good fit for linear models in agricultural price forecasting.\n",
    "    * *Current Status:* indicating linear models are insufficient for this task's complexity.\n",
    "* **R² ≥ 0.9 for Random Forest:**\n",
    "    * *Justification:* Ensemble methods like Random Forest are expected to achieve high accuracy for complex, non-linear relationships.\n",
    "    * *Current Status:* demonstrating strong predictive performance.\n",
    "    * *Note:* While 0.9 is excellent, 0.88 is still very good and could be considered acceptable depending on the specific business requirements.\n",
    "* **MAE < 0.1:**\n",
    "    * *Justification:* Represents a prediction error of less than 10% on average avocado prices ($1-2), considered actionable for business planning.\n",
    "    * *Current Status:* indicating good absolute prediction accuracy.\n",
    "* **RMSE < 0.15:**\n",
    "    * *Justification:* Captures and penalizes larger prediction errors, crucial for preventing costly business decisions based on outliers.\n",
    "    * *Current Status:* showing good performance with limited large errors.\n",
    "    * *Note:* It is important to remember that RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than MAE.\n",
