    "## Addressing Teacher's Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully There is a chance for retake\n",
    "On my previous version I got 4.4 ( consider failed ) also received feedback highlighting several areas for improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lack of accompanying text, explanations, and reasoning**\n",
    "2. **No clear definition of CRISP-DM phase objectives**\n",
    "3. **Insufficient justification for selecting critical criteria**\n",
    "4. **No reflection on data visualization findings**\n",
    "5. **Missing weather data exploration and correlation analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "These enhanced notebooks directly address this feedback by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adding detailed explanations** for every code block\n",
    "2. **Clearly defining objectives** for each CRISP-DM phase\n",
    "3. **Providing justifications** for all decisions with references to research\n",
    "4. **Reflecting on visualizations** and explicitly linking findings to next steps\n",
    "5. **Thoroughly exploring weather data** and its correlation with avocado prices\n",

    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict Hass avocado prices in various regions of the United States. The prediction model will utilize historical data including sales volumes, types of avocados, regional information, and weather data to forecast future prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the CRISP-DM methodology, the project will proceed through the following phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "- Define objectives and success criteria\n",
    "- Assess situation and resources\n",
    "- Establish project plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Understanding\n",
    "- Explore avocado price and volume data\n",
    "- Analyze weather data and its relationship to prices\n",
    "- Identify data quality issues\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Preparation\n",
    "- Clean and transform raw data\n",
    "- Feature engineering for temporal, categorical, and regional variables\n",
    "- Create training, validation, and test datasets\n",
    "- Document all transformations for reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Modeling\n",
    "- Develop baseline models (Linear Regression)\n",
    "- Implement advanced models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "- Document model architecture and training process\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Evaluation\n",
    "- Assess model performance against technical criteria\n",
    "- Evaluate business value of insights\n",
    "- Compare different modeling approaches\n",
    "- Identify strengths and limitations"
