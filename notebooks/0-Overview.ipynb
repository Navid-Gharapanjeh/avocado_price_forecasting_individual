    "\n",
    "Luckily there is a chance for retake\n",
    "On my previous version I got 4.4 ( consider failed ) also received feedback highlighting several areas for improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lack of accompanying text, explanations, and reasoning**\n",
    "2. **No clear definition of CRISP-DM phase objectives**\n",
    "3. **Insufficient justification for selecting critical criteria**\n",
    "4. **No reflection on data visualization findings**\n",
    "5. **Missing weather data exploration and correlation analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "These enhanced notebooks directly address this feedback by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adding detailed explanations** for every code block\n",
    "2. **Clearly defining objectives** for each CRISP-DM phase\n",
    "3. **Providing justifications** for all decisions with references to research\n",
    "4. **Reflecting on visualizations** and explicitly linking findings to next steps\n",
    "5. **Thoroughly exploring weather data** and its correlation with avocado prices\n",

    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict Hass avocado prices in various regions of the United States. The prediction model will utilize historical data including sales volumes, types of avocados, regional information, and weather data to forecast future prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the CRISP-DM methodology, the project will proceed through the following phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "- Define objectives and success criteria\n",
    "- Assess situation and resources\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Understanding\n",
    "- Explore avocado price and weather datasets\n",
    "- Analyze data quality and completeness\n",
    "- Visualisation of data to identify trends and patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Preparation\n",
    "- Find and handle missing values\n",
    "- Find outliers and handle them\n",
    "- Save the cleaned data for modeling\n",
    "- Feature engineering\n",
    "- convert categorical variables to numerical/binary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Modeling\n",
    "- Split the data into training and testing sets\n",
    "- Develop baseline models (Linear Regression)\n",
    "- Implement advanced models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)\n",
    "- Combine weather data with avocado price data and retrain models with random forest\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Evaluation\n",
    "- Assess model performance against technical criteria\n",
    "- Evaluate business value of insights\n",
    "- Compare different modeling approaches\n",
    "- Identify strengths and limitations\n",
