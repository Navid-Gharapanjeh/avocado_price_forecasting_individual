# Notebook Development Plan

This document outlines the plan for developing enhanced Jupyter notebooks that address the teacher's feedback and follow the CRISP-DM methodology for the avocado price forecasting project.

## Addressing Teacher's Feedback

The teacher's feedback highlighted several key areas for improvement:

1. **Lack of explanations and reasoning**: "The code is present and correct, but there is a lack of accompanying text, explanations, and reasoning for the decisions you made."

2. **Missing justification for criteria**: "The Business Understanding section looks good, but you do not provide a clear reason for selecting certain critical criteria."

3. **No reflection on visualizations**: "While you provide some nice visualizations in the data preparation phase, you never make any decisions based on your findings or reflect on the data."

4. **Missing weather data exploration**: "In the data understanding phase, you also do not explore potential correlations with weather data."

5. **Insufficient explanation of CRISP-DM phases**: "There is no clear definition of what you are trying to achieve in each phase or an explanation of what you are doing and why."

## Development Approach

For each notebook, I will:

1. **Structure with clear sections** corresponding to logical steps within that CRISP-DM phase
2. **Begin each section with explanatory text** describing what I aim to accomplish and why
3. **Follow each code block with detailed interpretation** of results and reasoning
4. **Explicitly link findings to decisions** made in subsequent steps
5. **Include references to research** or best practices to justify key decisions
6. **Summarize key takeaways** at the end of each notebook

## Notebook Development Schedule

### 1. Business Understanding Notebook

**Objective**: Establish a comprehensive business context and justify all criteria and assumptions.

**Key improvements**:
- Add industry research citations to justify success criteria
- Include detailed stakeholder analysis and value proposition
- Provide explicit reasoning for each selected performance metric
- Reference similar forecasting projects in related domains

**Completion timeline**: 1 day

### 2. Data Understanding Notebook

**Objective**: Thoroughly explore and document all aspects of both avocado and weather datasets.

**Key improvements**:
- Add comprehensive weather data exploration section
- Create visualizations showing correlations between weather and prices
- Include detailed explanations of data patterns and anomalies
- Document explicit "findings and implications" after each analysis
- Add a dedicated section on avocado types and PLU codes

**Completion timeline**: 2 days

### 3. Data Preparation Notebook

**Objective**: Document all data transformation decisions with clear reasoning.

**Key improvements**:
- Explain each data cleaning step with justification
- Document feature engineering choices with business reasoning
- Show before/after examples of transformations
- Provide explicit rationale for handling outliers and missing values
- Demonstrate the impact of weather data integration

**Completion timeline**: 2 days

### 4. Modeling Notebook

**Objective**: Justify model selection and document all modeling decisions.

**Key improvements**:
- Add literature review of forecasting approaches for similar problems
- Provide detailed explanation of each model's strengths and weaknesses
- Document hyperparameter selection process with reasoning
- Include explicit justification for each modeling decision
- Show detailed model diagnostics and interpretation

**Completion timeline**: 2 days

### 5. Evaluation Notebook

**Objective**: Comprehensively evaluate models against business criteria with detailed interpretation.

**Key improvements**:
- Connect each evaluation metric to business impact
- Provide detailed analysis of prediction errors
- Include visualizations of model performance by region and type
- Document evaluation of model stability and generalizability
- Include A/B comparison with baseline approaches

**Completion timeline**: 1 day

### 6. Deployment Notebook

**Objective**: Create actionable deployment plan with clear business recommendations.

**Key improvements**:
- Include detailed implementation steps
- Document model monitoring approach
- Provide segment-specific business recommendations
- Include sensitivity analysis for key variables
- Outline future enhancement opportunities

**Completion timeline**: 1 day

## Implementation Priorities

When implementing each notebook, I will prioritize:

1. **Quality over quantity**: Fewer, more insightful visualizations with thorough interpretation
2. **Business relevance**: Explicitly connect all analysis to business objectives
3. **Clear reasoning**: Document the "why" behind every decision
4. **Actionable insights**: Ensure all findings lead to specific recommendations
5. **Comprehensive documentation**: Leave no step unexplained

## Validation Plan

After completing each notebook, I will review it to ensure:

1. Every code block has accompanying explanations
2. All decisions are justified with clear reasoning
3. Visualizations include detailed interpretation and next steps
4. Business objectives are consistently referenced
5. The narrative flow is logical and comprehensive

By following this plan, I will address all aspects of the teacher's feedback and create a professional, well-documented data science project.
